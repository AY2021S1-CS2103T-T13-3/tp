## Project: FitEgo

FitEgo is a desktop application for fitness instructors to schedule, and keep track of his/her customers' progress in one place.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add and delete schedules. (Pull Request [#81](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/81), [#96](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/96))
  * What it does: allows the user to create and delete schedules. A schedule contains information about a client and the attended session. Therefore, adding a schedule means that the specified client will attend the specified session. 
  * Justification: This feature is core to the product because the user needs to be able to associate a client to a session. This is necessary for the later enhancements in the project such as the ability of tracking the sessions attended by a client and tracking which clients will attend a session.
  * Highlights: Before implementing this feature, a Schedule model must be implemented first. When implementing the Schedule model (which is then implemented as an association class of client and session) and how it should be stored in the storage, in-depth design analysis were needed.

* **New Feature**: Added the payment tracking feature (PR [#137](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/137))
  * What it does: Associate each schedule (which contains a client and session) to a payment status (either paid or unpaid) such that the user can easily spot whether a client has paid for a particular session.
  * Justification: This feature helps the user to easily keep track of his clients' payment record
  * Highlights: The implementation requires a good understanding in UI (including CSS coloring) and how it relates to the logic as in both Session List panel and client detail's table, different color will be displayed depending on the payment status.

  * Contributed to `v1.3` demo for tutorial and some non-feature-specific documentations
  * Maintained issue tracker

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Modified and enhanced `cedit` from `edit` command (PR [#53](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/53), [\#165](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/165))
  * Modified Session model to use interval as unique identifier (PR [#95](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/95))
  * Modified saving to Storage to include Schedule objects (PR [#74](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/74))

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `schadd` and `schdel`. (PR [\#143](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/143))
    * Added documentation for the feature `cedit`. (PR [\#242](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/242))
    * Added information on duplicate client. (PR [\#230](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/230))
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `schadd` feature. (PR [\#149](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/149))
    * Updated the diagram of the Storage component. (PR [\#149](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/149))

* **Review or mentoring contributions**:
  * Discuss design and implementation details with group mates.
  * Discuss bugs and proposals during team meeting or via issues (example: [issue \#141](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/issues/141), [issue \#174](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/issues/174)).
  * Review and comment on PRs regarding code quality (PR [#91](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/91)), implementation bug (PR [#226](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/226)), and other improvements.
  * Beyond this team: reported bugs and suggestion for other team (examples: PR [#188](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/issues/188))
