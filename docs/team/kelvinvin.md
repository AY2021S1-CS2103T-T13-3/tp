## Project: FitEgo

FitEgo is a desktop application used to help fitness instructors with organizing their schedule and monitoring of clients' progress and payment status. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 14 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to change view of Session List.
  * What it does: allows the user to filter the Session List to only those that start within the requested period.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can now re-prioritise and make changes to their schedule much more conveniently.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing session-related and schedule-related commands. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to the Logic component.
  * Credits: *{Credits to teammates Tan Wei Jie for adding variable range ability and Maguire Ong for assisting with Ui-related matters of the Session List}*

* **New Feature**: Added a weight unit utility class to facilitate conversion of units.
  * What it does: allows the user to both input and output weight in terms of kilogram or pounds.
  * Justification: This feature improves the usability of the product significantly because it widens the scope of users to include both categories of people who use Metric and Imperial systems.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing weight-related commands and graph. 
    It also necessitated the implementation of an additional user preference field that users can set via a Settings window. 
    The implementation was challenging because it was built to reduce coupling with other classes and required usage of Observer pattern to enable dynamic updates.
  * Credits: *{Reused code from the Help window to implement the Settings window}*

* **Project management**:
  * Managed timely updates of demo for tutorials

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Added wrap text to increase text readability for small resolutions. [\#218](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/218)
  * Refactored Delete and List commands to equivalent Client commands.
  
* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `sview`, `cdel` and `settings` [\#229](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/229) [\#171](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/171) [\#159](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/159) 
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
    * Ensured accurate grammar and consistency of commonly used terms [\#157](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/157) [\#23](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/23)
    * Created an annotated diagram of Ui components.

  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `cdel` feature.
    * Updated diagrams and description of the Logic component.
    * Increased readability by rephrasing sections and improved consistency in punctuation and grammar. [\#227](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/227), [\#218](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/pull/218)
