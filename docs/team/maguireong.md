## Project: FitEgo

FitEgo is a desktop application for fitness instructors to keep track of his/her customers easily, so that he can spend more time on his clients/his routine rather than manually tracking administrative matters using alternative software like Excel.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit a session created by the user.
  * What it does: Allows the user to edit a session’s details like a session’s gym name, exercise type, start time and duration.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a client may have changes made to his/her workout session, therefore the app should provide a way to make changes to the session.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
                It builds the foundation for edit features in FitEgo. The implementation was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit a schedule created by the user.
  * What it does: Allows the user to edit a schedule’s details like a schedule’s updated session index, payment status, remark and weight.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may have changes made to his schedules, therefore the app should provide a way to make update the changes to the schedule.
  * Highlights: This enhancement was similar to the edit session feature. However, the implementation was slightly different form the edit session feature. 
                Much consideration was put into this implementation for ease of usage of this feature, therefore more time was required to create this feature.
  * Credits: {Credits to teammates Bennett and Dhafin for adding additional parameters that can be edited in the feature}

* **New Feature**: Added a dynamic header on the right side panel.
  * What it does: Allows the user to have a better idea of the time period searched for when using the “Session View” function.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can better identify which time period it is referring to.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of JavaFX.
                The implementation too was challenging enough as a new user to JavaFX.
