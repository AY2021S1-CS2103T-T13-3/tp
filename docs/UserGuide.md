Welcome to FitEgo! This document will serve as an user guide to the all-in-one scheduling application.

Made for **fitness instructors** in mind, **FitEgo** is a **desktop program** that helps them **manage their clients and schedules**, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, **FitEgo** can get your client management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

### 1.2 How to use FitEgo

FitEgo supports a lot of [commands](#5-command-summary), and it might seem daunting to learn all at once. This section aims to solve that, and guide you to understand how most FitEgo's commands are structured!

There are 3 major entities in FitEgo (clients, sessions, and schedules), and 5 major verbs (add, edit, delete, view, list).

Let's first look at the entities.

#### Clients

If you have a new client interested in your fitness training services, FitEgo can help you to keep track of their information, such as their injury history and contact number.  

All [client-related commands](#32-client-related-keywords) use the prefix `c`. 

#### Sessions

Sessions are a timeslot that is scheduled for a training session. It contains information about the gym, the session's main exercise type, start time and the duration of sessions.

If you want to host a new training session, you can create it and FitEgo can help you to keep track of its details.

Each session can have more than 1 client, to model a trainer instructing a fitness class.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> 

:information_source: **Info:**
FitEgo doesn't allow user to create overlapping sessions. We consider two sessions as overlapping if another session starts before the current session ends.
This is to prevent accidental schedule overlaps at different gyms. 
</div>


All [session-related commands](#33-session-related-keywords) have prefix `s`.

#### Schedules

Once you have created a session, you can schedule your clients to sessions. 

Schedules are what defines you and your client's interaction. Each schedule contains information about the client and the attended session. 

The bullet points listed below are some information you can record in a schedule.
- your client's weight if you have recorded your client's weight during a session
- exercises done by your client during the session as remark
- your client's payment status on whether he has paid for the session or not

The table below shows an example of schedules. The session at Machoman Gym is attended by 2 clients. For each client, we can take note of their weight, activities, and payment status. 

<center> Table 1 - Example of Schedule Tracking </center>

| Client   | Session                                                      | Weight | Remark                                                       | Payment Status |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| John Doe | Endurance training at Machoman Gym (24/10/2020 1200 - 1400)  | 70 kg  | Planks (20 x 30 seconds), body weight squats (5 sets of 25 reps) | paid           |
| Alex | Endurance training at Machoman Gym (24/10/2020 1200 - 1400)  | 60 kg  | Planks (10 x 30 seconds) | unpaid           |
| Bernice  | Body building training at Getwell Gym (27/10/2020 1300 - 1500) | 85 kg  | Chinup (5 sets of 5 reps), muscle strain after bench press   | paid         |

All [schedule-related commands](#34-schedule-related-keywords) have prefix `sch`.

#### Verbs 

Once you learn the entities, you can now combine it with the verbs. For example, if you combine `c` (client prefix) and `add` (verb for adding an entity), you have `cadd` which adds a client to FitEgo.

Other examples include:

- `sadd`: Adds a session, `schadd`: Adds a schedule
- `cdel`: Deletes a client, `sdel`: Deletes a session, `schdel`: Deletes a schedule
    
### 1.3 General Note

The program will automatically save after every command execution to guarantee that your data will never be lost.

# 3 Keyword

In this section, you can find all the keywords that will help you fully utilize FitEgo.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/injured-thigh` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/injured-thigh`, `t/injured-thigh t/allergy-dairy` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

</div>

This program has separated the keywords into 4 different categories - [Main](#31-main-keywords),
[Client](#32-client-related-keywords), [Session](#33-session-related-keywords) and [Schedule](#34-schedule-related-keywords).

## 3.1 Main Keywords
All main keywords are described in this section.

### 3.1.1 Viewing home : `home`

You can return to the home page by using this command. 

<center><img src="images/homepage.png" alt="homepage"/></center>

---

## 3.2 Client-related Keywords
All client-related keywords are described in this section. All of the commands here will interact with the Client List which is located at the [left of the UI](#2-ui-orientation). 

<center><img src="images/ClientPanel.png" alt="client_panel" width="250" height="400" />
<br/>Figure 6 - Sample of Client List</center>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> 

:information_source: **Note:**

The `Next Session` field below each Client shows you the earliest upcoming session. It is not updated in real-time but after FitEgo executes a command.

</div>

### 3.2.1 Listing all clients : `clist`

You can view the list of all clients in FitEgo. The list of clients will be shown at the Client List. 

By default, Client List will display all the clients. In case you used [`cfind`](#324-locating-clients-by-name--cfind) or any filter-typed commands, 
you can use `clist` to view the entire list of clients.  

Format: `clist`

### 3.2.2 Adding a Client : `cadd`

You can add a client to the Client List including their details. This allows you to easily refer to their information when needed. 

Format: `cadd n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL [t/TAG]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A client can have any number of tags (including 0). Each tag can include
alphanumeric characters or dash (`-`), but you are not allowed to start or end
a tag with a dash. 
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

:star: **Feature:**

You can add profile picture to your client by storing their photo in `data/images` folder. You should name the photo 
as `profile-<client's full name in lowercase and separated by dash>.jpg`. <br/> For example, if your client's name is Alex Yeoh, 
store his photo as `data/images/profile-alex-yeoh.jpg`
</div>

Examples:
* `cadd n/Jane Doe p/91234567 e/jane@gmail.com`
* `cadd n/John Doe p/91231367 e/jojo@gmail.com t/injured-thigh`

### 3.2.3 Editing a Client : `cedit`

If your client has any changes made to his details, then you can edit a client in the Client List. This helps you to reflect the latest information.

Format: `cedit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]`

Points to take note when editing a client's information:
* Edits the client at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed Client List. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the client will be removed, i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all of the client’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* After performing a `cedit` command, you will see the updated client information page.

Examples:
*  `cedit 1 n/Janie Doe` Edits the name of the first client to be `Janie Doe`
*  `cedit 1 t/` Removes all of the tags of the first client

### 3.2.4 Locating Clients by Name : `cfind`

You can find clients whose name contain any of the given keywords, and see the result in the Client List.

Format: `cfind KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Points to take note when finding clients by name:
* The search is case-insensitive, e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter, e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* Only the name is searched.
* Partial names will be matched, e.g. `Han` will match `Hans`.
* Clients matching any substring will be returned (i.e. `OR` search),
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.

Examples:
* `cfind John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `cfind alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li` as shown in the image below <br>

<center><img src="images/findAlexDavidResult.png" alt="result for 'find alex david'" width="400" height="400" /></center>
<center> Figure 7 - Result of finding clients by name </center>


### 3.2.5 Deleting a Client : `cdel`

If you are no longer taking up a client, you can delete the client which can be found in the Client List. This helps in reducing obsolete information.

Format: `cdel INDEX`

Points to take note when deleting a client from the Client List:
* Deletes the client at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed Client List.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `clist` followed by `cdel 2` deletes the second client in the resulting Client List
* `cfind Bernice` followed by `cdel 1` deletes the first client with the name 'Bernice' in the resulting Client List
    * If Bernice is not associated with any schedule, Bernice's client information is immediately deleted
    * If Bernice is associated with one or more schedules, you will see a warning message about the conflict and how to force delete

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

:star: **Feature:**

- To force delete a client (and his associated schedules), pass in the optional force flag after the `INDEX`. 
Any string after the force flag (`f/`) will be ignored.

- If you perform [`cdel`](#325-deleting-a-client--cdel), you will be returned to the homepage.
</div>

* If there are one or more associated schedules associated with Bernice, `cfind Bernice` followed by `cdel 1 f/` will:
        1. Delete all schedules associated with Bernice
        2. Then, delete Bernice's client information.

### 3.2.6 Viewing a Client : `cview`

You can view the full details of a client from the Client List. 

You can easily look up the following information about the client in the central panel:
* Your client's name, email, address, phone, tags
* Your client's weight history in line graph form
* A list of schedules associated with your client, together with the interval, exercise type and remark

Format: `cview INDEX`

Points to take note when viewing clients from the Client List:
* Views the client at the specified `INDEX`. The selected client will be displayed in the main window. 
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed Client List.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...
* You can use `F3` to view your client's list of schedules, and `F4` to view your client's weight progression.
* You can sort the list of schedules by the interval or exercise type.

Examples:
* `cview 2` opens the second client in FitEgo
* `cfind Bernice` followed by `cview 1` opens the first client (Bernice) in the resulting Client List

<br>

The result of these commands is shown in the image below

## 3.3 Session-related Keywords 

All session-related keywords are described in this section. All of the commands here will interact with the Session List which is located at the [right of the UI](#2-ui-orientation). The figure below shows how it looks like.

<center><img src="images/SessionPanel.png" alt="session_panel" width="250" height="450" /><br/>
Figure 9 - Sample of Session List</center><br/>
The `ALL` at the top of this Session List panel represents the current period of session view. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
The default period of session view is 'WEEK'. You can change the period 
of session view using [`sview`](#viewing-sessions-within-period--sview) command. 
</div>
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> 

:information_source: **Note:**


### 3.3.1 Adding a Session : `sadd`

If you have planned a session in your timetable, you can create a session with its relevant details. This provides you with an easy reference to the periods where you are not available and the location of the session.

Format: `sadd g/GYM_NAME ex/EXERCISE_TYPE at/START_TIME t/DURATION`

Points to take note when adding a session to the Session List:
* Start time should be of format "dd/MM/yyyy HHmm".
* Duration is in minutes.
* Duration should be a positive integer (larger than 0).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
    The session's time should not overlap with previously created sessions. 
</div>

Examples:
* `sadd g/Machoman Gym ex/Endurance at/29/09/2020 1600 t/120` - Adds a session at gym `Machoman` with exercise type `Endurance` at `29/09/2020 1600hrs` that lasts for `120` minutes


### 3.3.2 Editing a Session : `sedit`

You can edit the details of the session identified by the index number used in the displayed Session List. This ensures that you can always record the latest changes.

Format: `sedit INDEX [g/GYM_NAME] [ex/EXERCISE_TYPE] [at/START_TIME t/DURATION]`

Points to take note when editing a session's details from the Session List:
* Edits the session at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed Session List. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* `GYM_NAME` and `EXERCISE_TYPE` can be any words.
* `START_TIME` and `DURATION` convention follows the command `sadd`.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

Examples:
*  `sedit 1 g/Machoman at/29/09/2020 1600 t/120 ` - Edits the gym of the first session to be `Machoman` and the start time and duration to be `29/09/2020 1600 with a duration of 120 minutes` while keeping all other fields the same
*  `sedit 2 at/29/09/2020 1600 t/120 ` - Edits the start time and duration of the second session to be `29/09/2020 1600 with a duration of 120 minutes` while keeping all other fields the same


### 3.3.3 Deleting a Session : `sdel`

You can delete the session specified by the index number used in the displayed Session List and all schedules associated with
the specified session. This helps you keep track of only sessions that are still relevant to you.

Format: `sdel INDEX [f/]`

Points to take note when deleting a session from the Session List:
* Deletes the session at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed Session List.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:
* If there are no schedules associated with the second session in the Session List, `sview p/all` followed by `sdel 2` deletes the second session
* If there are one or more associated schedules associated with the second session in the Session List, `sview p/all` followed by `sdel 2`, you will see an error message

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

:star: **Feature:**

To force deletion of session (and all associated schedules), pass in the optional force flag after the `INDEX`. 
    Any string after the force flag (`f/`) will be ignored.
</div>

* If there are one or more schedules associated with the second session, 
  `list` followed by `sdel 2 f/` will delete all schedules associated with the second session, then delete the session itself
  
  
### 3.3.4 Viewing Sessions within Period : `sview`
You can filter the Session List to view sessions within requested period. This helps you to prioritise your sessions as needed.

Format: `sview p/PERIOD`

Points to take note when viewing session from the Session List:
 * Filters the Session List to display sessions within the specified period.
 * On top of the Session List, you can find the type of the period you are viewing.
 * The recognized periods are as follows:
 
 <center>Table 3 - List of recognized periods </center>
 
 | Period | Sessions displayed |
 | -------- | -------- |
 | all| All sessions (including past ones)|
 | future | All sessions that have not started|
 | past | All sessions that have already ended|
 | week | All sessions within the next 7 days (inclusive of today)|
 | `+[x][unit]` | Sessions within next x time units|
 | `-[x][unit]` | Sessions within past x time units|
 
 
 * The recognized units are as follows:
 <center>Table 4 - List of recognized time units </center>
 
 | Unit | Time unit parsed |
 | -------- | -------- |
 | d / D | day |
 | w / W | week |
 | m / M | month |
 | y / Y| year |
  
<center><img src="images/sview_sample.png" alt="result for 'sview p/+2w'"/><br>
Figure 10 - Result of running 'sview p/+2w' </center>

Examples:
 
* `sview p/all` - Display all sessions stored in FitEgo
* `sview p/+0D` - Display all sessions today
* `sview p/-1d` - Display all sessions from the past 1 day to today (yesterday and today)
* `sview p/+2w` - Display all sessions from today to 2 weeks later. (e.g. If today is Friday, display from today to the Friday that falls 2 weeks later)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> 

:information_source: **Note:**

The effect of `sview` is not updated in real-time but after FitEgo executes a command. For example, if you 
1. run `sview p/+0D` at 2359hrs on Friday
2. do not execute any command until 0000 hrs on Saturday

the Session List will still be showing Friday's sessions at that point of time. To update, simply run any command successfully in FitEgo.
</div>

---

## 3.4 Schedule-related Keywords 
All schedule-related keywords are described in this section. All of the commands here will interact with the various parts of [Ui](#2-ui-orientation). 

To check if you have scheduled a session with a client, you can check if the session in the Session List contains the client's name. 

<center> <img src="images/SchedulePanel.png" alt="schedule_panel" width="250" height="450" /><br>
Figure 11 - Alternate sample of Session List</center><br/>

The figure above shows the Session List, in which for each session, there is a list of clients attending the session. Clients who have paid for a session will have their name shown in <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">green</span>, while those who have not  will have their name shown in <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">red</span>.

### 3.4.1 Adding a Schedule : `schadd`

You can schedule your client for a session. You can use this command to indicate that a client will attend one of your session.

Format: `schadd c/CLIENT_INDEX s/SESSION_INDEX`

Points to take note when adding a schedule:
* This will create a schedule associated with the specified client and session.
* The client is specified by `CLIENT_INDEX`, and the session is specified by `SESSION_INDEX`.
* `CLIENT_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the Client List, and **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …
* `SESSION_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the Session List, and **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …

Example:

* `schadd c/1 s/1` - Schedules the first client in the Client List with the first session in the Session List

### 3.4.2 Editing a Schedule : `schedit`

If you want to change your client's session, payment status or remarks, you can edit the details of this schedule identified by the client index and session index.

Format: `schedit c/CLIENT_INDEX s/SESSION_INDEX [us/UPDATED_SESSION_INDEX] [pd/PAYMENT_STATUS] [r/REMARK] [w/WEIGHT]`

Points to take note when editing a schedule's details:
* Edits the schedule that consists of the client and session indicated by `CLIENT_INDEX` and `SESSION_INDEX`.
* `CLIENT_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the Client List. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …
